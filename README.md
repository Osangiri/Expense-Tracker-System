# Expense-Tracker-System
Involves use JaCoCo, plantUML and basis java coding. 
## Expense Tracker System

The GUI file in this repository contains  different classes to for my Expense Tracker Project.<br/>
My Classes include:
 - MainFinals
 - ExpenseTracker
 - Expense
 - BinaryTree
 - Expenses.txt
 - MainFinals.puml - plantUMl
 - buid.xml - Jacoco tester
All these classes use different concepts learnt in Java<br/>
The Expense Tracker Project is a java application designed to help users to manage their expenses efficiently. It has features for adding, viewing, and categorizing expenses as well as generating reports. <br/>
To use the expense Tracker excecute the MainFinals class to start the application and select one of the menu options.</br>
<br/>
The build.xml contains code for jacoco tester to measure code coverage in tests.I was able to learn the importance of JaCoCo as it  provides insights into the effectiveness of tests and helps identify untested parts of the code, ensuring higher quality and better test coverage. It was great learning about Jacoco through this project.

### Concepts used from CS143
- ArrayList
- Lamdas and streams
- Binary Tree
- Maps and sets
- Recursion

### Error Handling
- Invalid input - Throws appropriate error for invalid formats
- Duplicate entries - Prevents duplicate records during saving
- File errors - Handles file errors
### Future Improvements
- Adding graphic user interface using JavaFX
- Implement support to export to exel file
- Enable a more personalized expense tracker with user authentication<br/>
